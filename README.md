### M4 MVC Example Application

This is example application for [M4 MVC Framework](https://github.com/Matoo125/m4mvc)

App should be run either through virtual host root directory or with `/?url=controller/method`

Url rewritting can be set to folder in `.htaccess`, but folder name should not contain dashes or any special characters. So if you rename project to *m4app* you can set `RewriteBase /m4app/` and it should be working as `localhost/controller/method/param1/param2`

This application does not do much, but you can get the basics of how it should work from it. Feel free to contact me if you have questions. I'll try to improve this in future.
